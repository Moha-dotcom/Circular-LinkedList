# Circular-LinkedList

This is very similar to the standard DLL with the only difference being the connection of the head with the tail. That means, 
we link the head the tail to each other, 
which we can visualise as a circle, because a circle has no start and no end.

Because the head and the tail of the list are connected to each other, we can say that there is no start and no end.
